## Template 1: Direct Approach (Warm Lead)

**Subject:** Your business needs a professional website

Hi [Name],

I was checking out [business name] on Instagram and your work looks great — but I noticed you're running everything through DMs.

That's chaos waiting to happen. Accounts get locked. Messages get buried. Your audience never actually belongs to you.

**Here's what I do:** I build professional websites that you fully own. Not rented platforms. Not monthly subscriptions. Your website. Your domain. Your control.

**Starting at $999**, you get:
- Custom 1–5 page professional website
- Your own domain
- Secure hosting that you own
- SSL security included
- 30-day support

Your website works for you 24/7. DMs don't.

If you're ready to stop running your business from someone else's platform, let's talk.

## Template 2: Problem-Solution (Cold Lead)

Hi [Name],

Your work is strong. But you're building your business on rented land.

I help businesses like yours get a professional website that you fully own. Not rented. Not under platform control.

**Here's the breakdown:**

| Protection & Performance | Security hardening, automated backups, uptime monitoring | +$750 |
| Automation & Organization | Client intake automation, form routing, workflows | +$1,000 |

**One-time investment. Permanent ownership.**

Your website works while you sleep. Captures leads. Builds credibility. Protects your business from platform volatility.

## Template 3: Value-First (Referrals)

**Subject:** Quick question about [business name]

Hi [Name],

Quick question — do you have a professional website for [business name]?

Most service businesses (barbershops, contractors, local brands) rely on Instagram and DMs because it feels "easy." But it's actually chaos:

- Messages get buried
- No professional booking system
- No way to capture lead info
- One algorithm change and you're invisible

**A professional website solves this:**

✓ 24/7 online presence
✓ Professional booking/contact forms
✓ SEO — people find you on Google
✓ You own everything (no platform risk)
✓ One-time investment (no monthly fees)

I built [business name] a professional website starting at $999. You own the domain. You own the hosting. No monthly subscriptions.

If you want to see what that looks like, reply "interested" and I'll share some examples.

## Template 4: Short & Punchy (Follow-Up)

**Subject:** Still thinking about that website?

Hi [Name],

Following up on my last email.

**The reality:** Every day you run your business without a website, you're paying an opportunity cost.

- Missed calls → Missed bookings
- DM-only → Looks unprofessional
- No Google presence → Competitors win

**A professional website fixes all of this.**

Starting at $999, you get a website that:
- Captures leads automatically
- Looks professional and builds trust
- Works for you 24/7
- **You own it forever**

No monthly fees. No platform drama.

I build professional websites for service businesses that you fully own. One-time investment starting at $999.

If you want to see examples or chat about it, reply "website" and I'll DM you more info.
